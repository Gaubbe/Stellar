# Stellar
A Hollow Knight pathfinding bot

## Building
To build this mod, you first need to modify the csproj file. Open it and you should see a tag named HKManaged. Change the path that is in there to the path to your Hollow Knight Managed folder **with the modding api installed**.

This mod uses the [hk-modding-api version 1.5.75.11827-63](https://github.com/hk-modding/api/releases/tag/1.5.75.11827-63).
